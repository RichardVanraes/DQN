    "In deep Q-learning, we use a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. The state is given as an input to the neural network. \n",
    "The output of the neural network represents the (estimated) Q-values of all possible actions. Using an argmax, we choose the action corresponding to the highest Q-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the Q network, we sample a batch of stored experiences from the replay memory. An experience is a tuple of (state, action, reward, next_state).\n",
    "We input the state into the Q network and get the estimated Q-values. For the Q network to adjust the weights, it needs to have an idea of how accurate these predicted Q-values are.\n",
    "However, we do not know the target or actual value here as we are dealing with a reinforcement learning problem. The solution is to estimate the target value by using a second neural network, called the target network. This target network will take the next state as an input and predict the Q-values for all possible actions from that state. \n",
    "Now we can compute the labels $y$ to train the policy network: $y = R(s, a) + \\gamma max_{a'}Q(s', a') - Q_{t-1}(s, a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q network can now be trained with the MSE loss. It's important to know that the target network is an exact copy of the policy network and the weights of the target network \n",
    "\n",
    "After a certain amount of Q-network updates, we copy its weights to the target network.\n",

Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Solved is 200 points. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.
